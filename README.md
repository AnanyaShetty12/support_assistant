Support Assistant built with Streamlit and Python using embeddings for FAQ matching

Support Assistant – FAQ Resolver & Escalation is a website designed to automate customer support. It allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive accurate answers from the FAQ database using semantic search and AI. The system compares user queries with existing FAQs using sentence embeddings and selects the best match based on similarity.
If the confidence is low or the query doesn't match any known FAQ, the system escalates the issue to human support.
